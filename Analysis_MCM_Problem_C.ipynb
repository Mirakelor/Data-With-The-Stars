    "### 9.1 Technical Derivation of the Optimal Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the optimal voting scheme, we solve a **Multi-Objective Optimization** problem. The goal is to maximize the program's commercial stability (retaining popular stars) while maintaining technical integrity (not eliminating top dancers).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Optimization Objectives\n",
    "*   **False Elimination Rate (FER)**: The probability that a contestant in the Top 3 of judge scores for a given week is eliminated. We want $\\text{FER} \\to 0$.\n",
    "*   **Retention Rate (RR)**: The probability that a contestant in the Top 3 of latent fan popularity is retained. We want $\\text{RR} \\to 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Grid Search Results\n",
    "We varied the judge weight $w$ from 0 to 1. \n",
    "- As $w \\uparrow$, **FER decreases** (better meritocracy) but **RR decreases** (risk of losing fan favorites).\n",
    "- A static weight of **$w \\approx 0.45$** provides a balanced \"Pareto optimal\" point where both metrics are stabilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The \"Dynamic Phase-Shift\" Strategy\n",
    "However, a static weight is sub-optimal across a full season. Our simulation shows that a **Dynamic Strategy** outperforms any fixed weight:\n",
    "*   **Weeks 1-8 (Engagement Phase)**: Set $w = 0.10$. We prioritize fan retention to build audience loyalty and protect diverse personalities.\n",
    "*   **Weeks 9+ (Championship Phase)**: Set $w = 0.45$. We increase judge influence to ensure the final winner possesses genuine technical skill.\n",
    "*   **The \"Safety Net\" Rule**: We implement a \"Bottom 3 Judge Save.\" If a technical Top-3 performer falls into the Bottom 3 of the composite score, the judges' vote automatically triggers to save them, displacing the next lowest non-technical performer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparative Performance:**\n",
    "*   **Static 50/50**: FER $\\approx 5.2\\%$, RR $\\approx 85\\%$.\n",
    "*   **Dynamic + Safety Net**: **FER = 0.0%**, **RR = 91.2%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dynamic scheme essentially eliminates \"Technical Outrages\" (like Heather Mills or Sabrina Bryan) while maintaining high audience engagement.\n"
